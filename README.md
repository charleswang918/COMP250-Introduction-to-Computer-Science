# Introduction-to-Computer-Science
## Contents
The contents of this repository consists of four assignments are given by [Prof. Michael Langer](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/index.html) for COMP 250 Introduction to Computer Science course during Fall 2021 at McGill University.
## Assignment 1-Implement a Memory class that defines a memory array and a linked list of objects
In this assignment we will work with the arrays and the Java LinkedList class, and also practice our basic Java programming skills. The scenario for this assignment is that we have a set of “strings” stored in a memory. The memory consists of an array of characters, and so each string will be stored in an interval of positions in that array. The goal is to put strings into the memory array, get strings from the memory array, or remove strings from the memory array. In doing so, we need to keep track of which strings are stored in memory (each string will have an id) and where the strings are. We will use a linked list for this bookkeeping task.
## Assignment 2-Implement a food places model based on a UML diagram
In this assignment, we will get some basic experience working with inheritance and polymorphism. We
model parts of a small economy, namely the food service industry. We model places where customers can
buy food: restaurants, food stands, and fast food. We model the payment of bills, including sales tax and
tip. We do not model many other things such as the food or menu. We also model a tax collector who
collects both sales tax and income tax. We only model one year: the workers each have some income and
pay tax for that year.
## Assignment 3-Tertiary Search Tree(TST) Implementation
In this assignment, we will work with a data structure that we will call a tertiary search tree or TST.1 This is like a binary
search tree (BST), except that each node in a TST has three children rather than two. We can call the three
children left, middle, and right. Each node stores a element whose class type implements Comparable,
so you can assume access to a compareTo() method. The subtrees defined by the left, middle, and right
children of a node have elements that are less than, equal to, or greater than the element at that node,
respectively.
## Assignment 4-Heap Implementation of a Priority Queue
In this assignment, we will complete heap implementation of a priority queue. We are required to implement the serval of methods in the ERPriorityQueue class. In addition, for each of methods in the ERPriorityQueue class, the worst case time complextiy with requirements.
